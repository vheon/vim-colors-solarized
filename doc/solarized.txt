Solarized Colorscheme					   *solarized*

Solarized is a carefully designed selective contrast colorscheme with dual
light and dark modes that runs in both GUI, 256 and 16 color modes.

See the homepage at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized for screenshots and 
details.

0. Install				|solarized-install|
1. Options				|solarized-options|
2. Toggle Background			|solarized-togglebg|
3. Terminal Issues			|solarized-term|

==============================================================================
0. Install						*solarized-install*

Note: I recommend using Tim Pope's pathogen plugin to install this 
colorscheme. See https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen . If you've installed 
pathogen properly you can install Solarized with the following commands, 
followed by the .vimrc configuration below.

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized.git

If you aren't using pathogen, you can use the following three steps to install 
Solarized:

1.  Download the solarized distribution (available on the homepage above)
    and unarchive the file.

2.  Move `solarized.vim` to your `.vim/colors` directory.

3.  Move each of the files in each subdirectories to the corresponding .vim
    subdirectory (e.g. autoload/togglebg.vim goes into your .vim/autoload
    directory as .vim/autoload/togglebg.vim).


After installation, place the following lines in your .vimrc:

	syntax enable
	set background=dark
	colorscheme solarized

or, for the light background mode of Solarized:

	syntax enable
	set background=light
	colorscheme solarized

==============================================================================
2. Toggle Background					*solarized-togglebg*
							*toggle-bg* *togglebg*
							*toggle-background*

Just set the 'background' property to 'light' or 'dark'

==============================================================================
3. Solarized Terminal Issues				*solarized-term*

If you are going to use Solarized in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI version 
like gvim or macvim), **please please please** consider setting your terminal 
emulator's colorscheme to used the Solarized palette. I've included palettes 
for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults in the official 
Solarized download available from the Solarized homepage listed at the top of 
this help document. If you use Solarized *without* these colors, Solarized 
will need to be told to degrade its colorscheme to a set compatible with the 
limited 256 terminal palette (whereas by using the terminal's 16 ansi color 
values, you can set the correct, specific values for the Solarized palette).

If you do use the custom terminal colors, solarized.vim should work out of 
the box for you. If you are using a terminal emulator that supports 256 
colors and don't want to use the custom Solarized terminal colors, you will 
need to use the degraded 256 colorscheme. To do so, simply add the following 
line *before* the `colorschem solarized` line:

    let g:solarized_termcolors=256

Again, I recommend just changing your terminal colors to Solarized values 
either manually or via one of the many terminal schemes available for import.

4. Solarized Options					*solarized-options*


OPTION LIST

Set these in your vimrc file prior to calling the colorscheme.

option name               default     optional
------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_termcolors=   16      |   256
g:solarized_termtrans =   0       |   1
g:solarized_degrade   =   0       |   1
g:solarized_bold      =   1       |   0
g:solarized_underline =   1       |   0
g:solarized_italic    =   1       |   0
g:solarized_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high" or "low"
g:solarized_visibility=   "normal"|   "high" or "low"
g:solarized_hitrail   =   0       |   1
------------------------------------------------


OPTION DETAILS

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_termcolors=   256     |   16		*'solarized_termcolors'*
------------------------------------------------
The most important option if you are using vim in terminal (non gui) mode!
This tells Solarized to use the 256 degraded color mode if running in a 256
color capable terminal.  Otherwise, if set to `16` it will use the terminal
emulators colorscheme (best option as long as you've set the emulators colors
to the Solarized palette).

If you are going to use Solarized in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI
version like gvim or macvim), **please please please** consider setting your
terminal emulator's colorscheme to used the Solarized palette. I've included
palettes for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults in the
official Solarized download available from:
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized . If you use Solarized without these
colors, Solarized will by default use an approximate set of 256 colors.  It
isn't bad looking and has been extensively tweaked, but it's still not quite
the real thing.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_termtrans =   0       |   1			*'solarized_termtrans'*
------------------------------------------------
If you use a terminal emulator with a transparent background and Solarized
isn't displaying the background color transparently, set this to 1 and
Solarized will use the default (transparent) background of the terminal
emulator. *urxvt* required this in my testing; iTerm2 did not.

Note that on Mac OS X Terminal.app, solarized_termtrans is set to 1 by 
default as this is almost always the best option. The only exception to this 
is if the working terminfo file supports 256 colors (xterm-256color).

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_degrade   =   0       |   1			*'solarized_degrade'*
------------------------------------------------
For test purposes only; forces Solarized to use the 256 degraded color mode
to test the approximate color values for accuracy.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_bold      =   1       |   0			*'solarized_bold'*
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_underline =   1       |   0			*'solarized_underline'*
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_italic    =   1       |   0			*'solarized_italic'*
------------------------------------------------
If you wish to stop Solarized from displaying bold, underlined or
italicized typefaces, simply assign a zero value to the appropriate
variable, for example: `let g:solarized_italic=0`

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high" or "low"	*'solarized_contrast'*
------------------------------------------------
Stick with normal! It's been carefully tested. Setting this option to high
or low does use the same Solarized palette but simply shifts some values up
or down in order to expand or compress the tonal range displayed.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_visibility =  "normal"|   "high" or "low" *'solarized_visibility'*
------------------------------------------------
Special characters such as trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, when 
displayed using ":set list" can be set to one of three levels depending on 
your needs.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_hitrail   =   0       |   1			*'solarized_hitrail'*
------------------------------------------------
Visibility can make listchar entities more visible, but if one has set 
cursorline on, these same listchar values standout somewhat less due to the 
background color of the cursorline. g:solarized_hitrail enables highlighting 
of trailing spaces (only one of the listchar types, but a particularly 
important one) while in the cursoline in a different manner in order to make 
them more visible. This may not work consistently as Solarized is using 
a pattern match than can be overridden by a more encompassing syntax-native 
match such as a comment line.
